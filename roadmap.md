## Editing Data

### Tools
* (express-validator)[https://express-validator.github.io]

### Forms
The steps to deal with forms are these:

  1. Validate fields
  2. Sanitize fields
  3. Analize data:
    * Invalid data: re-display form with data entered by user and error messages.
    * Valid data: save the entered values and redirect to the detail page.
